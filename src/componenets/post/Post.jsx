            Are you always a night owl?  

Wants to go to bed early but one thing or another comes up to your mind and you end up staying up late.  

Getting good sleep is one of the best habits for a healthy lifestyle. But we always struggle with that. I know what you are thinking “I already understand the importance of getting a good night’s sleep for at least 7-8 hrs. The only struggle is how to train me to go to bed earlier and sleep quickly.” 

Let me tell you one thing, it’s all related to bad planning. You don’t plan your day & evenings well. When you are working all day, you are so tired and end up with some tasks left for the day that flashes in your eyes when you are about to go to bed. Right? 

You need to learn how to make those minor changes to your routine and then stick to it. Sticking to some schedule seems difficult but first, just start with something small and then move on from there. I promise you will see some life-changing transformations in yourself.
